# Models Reference

This page lists models that expose structured output, reasoning, and/or text
verbosity settings. Model names prefer aliases where available; otherwise the
table shows the minimal model string (including provider prefix when required).
The provider column reflects the default provider used by fast-agent (models
may become available with multiple providers in the future).
