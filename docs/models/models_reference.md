# Models Reference

This page lists models that expose structured output, reasoning, text
verbosity, tokenization modality support, and built-in Anthropic web tools
(`web_search` / `web_fetch`) where available. Model names prefer aliases where
available; otherwise the table shows the minimal model string (including
provider prefix when required). The provider column reflects the default
provider used by fast-agent (models may become available with multiple
providers in the future).
