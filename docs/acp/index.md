# Agent Client Protocol

**`fast-agent`** has comprehensive support for Zed Industries [Agent Client Protocol](https://zed.dev/acp). 

Why use **`fast-agent`**?:

- Robust, native LLM Provider infrastructure, with Streaming and Structured outputs.
- Comprehensive MCP and Agent Skills support, including Tool Progress Notifications and Sampling.
- Build custom, multi-agent experiences in a few lines of code.

## Getting Started

## Customizing Agents

See [Customizing Agents](customizing_agents.md) for ACP-aware agents, slash commands, and controlling the ACP Mode display name/description.

### No Install Quick Start:
To try it out straight away with your Client, set an API Key environment variable and add:

**Hugging Face**

export HF_TOKEN=hf_.......

`uvx fast-agent-acp@latest --model <your_model> [e.g. kimi]` 

**Open AI**

export OPENAI_API_KEY=......

`uvx fast-agent-acp@latest  --model <your_model> [e.g. gpt-5-mini.low]` 

**Anthropic**

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=......

`uvx fast-agent-acp@latest --model <your_model> e.g. [sonnet]` 

Tip: Use `uvx fast-agent-acp check` to help diagnose issues.

The [default system prompt](../agents/instructions.md) will read `AGENTS.md` if present. Use `/status system` to check.

Note: OAuth keys are stored in your keyring, so `check` may prompt to read the credential store.

An example Zed configuration is:

```json
...
"agent_servers": {
    "fast-agent-uvx": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
        "fast-agent-acp@latest",
        "--model",
        "kimi",
        "-x",
        "--url",
        "https://huggingface.co/mcp"
        ],
        "env": { "HF_TOKEN": "hf_xxxxxxxxxxx" }
    }
}

```

### Hugging Face Inference ACP (`hf-inference-acp`)

`hf-inference-acp` is a dedicated ACP agent for Hugging Face Inference Providers (built on `fast-agent-mcp`).

- Run: `uvx hf-inference-acp@latest`
- Setup mode (when `HF_TOKEN` is missing) includes: `/set-model` (lists suggested models when called with no args), `/login`, `/check`
- `/set-model` accepts `alias`, `hf.<org>/<model>[:provider]`, or `<org>/<model>` (auto-adds `hf.` and can display available providers)

### Installing 

`uv tool install -U fast-agent-mcp`

The ACP Server can then be started with the `fast-agent-acp` command. Custom agents can be started with `uv run <agent.py> --transport acp`.

For example:

`fast-agent-acp -x --model kimi --url https://huggingface.co/mcp --auth ${HF_TOKEN}` 

Starts an ACP Agent, with shell access and access to the Hugging Face MCP Server.

Documentation in Progress.

## Shell and File Access

**`fast-agent`** adds the read and write tools from the Client to enable "follow-along" functionality.

## Permissions

Tool calls in ACP mode prompt for permission by default. You will see options for Allow Once / Always Allow / Reject Once / Never Allow.

- Disable prompts entirely with `fast-agent-acp --no-permissions` (all tools are allowed).
- Persistent “Always” decisions are stored in `.fast-agent/auths.md` in the working directory so you can audit or edit them later. The file is only created when you choose an “Always” option.
- “Once” decisions are remembered only for the current session and are not written to disk. Removing `.fast-agent/auths.md` clears any saved Always rules.
